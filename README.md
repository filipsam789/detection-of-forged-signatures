# detection-of-forged-signatures

**Topic: Detecting forged signatures using supervised learning and discovery of the similarity of the signatures**
> In collaboration with: Filip Samardjiski - https://github.com/filipsam789

**Subject**: Digital image processing

*In this project, we have considered multiple methods for detecting fake signatures using Supervised Learning, as well as comparing the similarity of two or more signatures. 
The project also includes a demo application in the Python programming language, which performs the necessary calculations and methods based on the user's selection 
of actions through standard input.*

*The model that proved to be the best and most consistent in terms of accuracy is Random Forest. It has the highest accuracies and has not shown a single instance of overfitting. 
This is most likely due to the random distribution of data and its attributes during the training process, and we could recommend it as an excellent choice of a
decision making model within the limits of this field of our project, considering the small amount of data we used.*

*All in all, we can say that with different parameter values of the different models, we could get higher and more consistent accuracies, but we will leave this to be resolved 
by our further learning and experience, which hopefully will help us further to upgrade and improve our app and its power.*
